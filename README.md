## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Apps I like are - 
  - Snapchat : 
     1. Messages are vanished after a certain duration
     2. Can maintain streaks by sending snaps
  - Whatsapp :
     1. Can call anyone all over the world
     2. Can delete sent messages
  - Instagram :
     1. Vanish mode helps with privacy
     2. Can upload stories and photos to share with everyone
  - Uber :
     1. Can schedule my uber days before
     2. Can select which level of vehicle to get uber as (sedan, etc)

#### App that I would like to build is a workout app with following features : 

    1. It helps me create a workout plan which can then be repeated. 
    2. It everyday reminds me of what would be my workout today and maintains a checklist for it. 
    3. It also logs the calories i burned using Apple Healthkit 
    4. Motivate me whenever I missed a day or I slacked off.
